  		<h1 id="hi-there">Hi there!</h1>
<p>Thank you for visiting my humble blog!  I write here about stuff I find interesting, and about
the silly projects I work on in my spare time.</p>
<h2 id="the-dl-on-spencer">the dl on spencer</h2>
<p>Spencer is a software developer in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p>At work, she's responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building out and maintaining an on-demand hosting platform for a large, spring-based e-commerce platform on AWS
that is used by the sales organization within the company.</li>
<li>Leading a fast-paced team of super smart developers that build increasingly complex sales demos in short time frames.</li>
<li>Expertly engineering demos of how we provide effective solutions for prospective customer's biggest e-commerce pain points.</li>
<li>Writing clean, simple, and easily maintained code in many languages and frameworks including Java, Spring, Javascript, React, Bash, Go, C++, Rust... etc</li>
<li>Moving mountains in record time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of her favorite things are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drinking great coffee (black as midnight on a moonless night)</li>
<li>Building cool things (she's pretty proud of the SID6581 MIDI synth she built)</li>
<li>Sim racing (these days she plays a lot of Dirt Rally 2.0, GT Sport, and Project Cars 2.  She's pretty fast.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can usually find her goofing around on <a href="https://github.com/spennydl">github</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bigspennyj">twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Drop her a line at spencerdleslie <code>@</code> gmail <code>.</code> com if you want to find out more!</p>
<h2 id="the-dl-on-the-dl">the dl on the dl</h2>
<p>It's my goal that the content presented on this site is both fun and informative.  You should have fun
reading it and walk away with some new knowledge, even if it's just a few new &quot;useless&quot; facts.</p>
<p>The site is just getting off the ground, but I'd love to hear your feedback!  To provide a place for 
discussion I often post about articles I write on reddit or twitter, but if you want to reach me
directly I'd love to hear from you!</p>
